# cdf-estimation
This is a small package designed to produce an estimate of a random variable's cumulative distribution function (cdf), given a set of i.i.d. samples from said variable. The estimation makes a calculated tradeoff between maximizing likelihood of a cdf, and maximizing a cdf's smoothness.
